        The <strong>Lang</strong>uage <strong>Navi</strong>gator is a tool designed to help people
        explore and understand the relationships between different languages. It provides a
        user-friendly interface for visualizing language families, dialects, and other linguistic
        features and how they are situated across the globe.

            The Language Navigator is built on the belief that language data should be accessible to
            everyone. We aim to provide a free and open-source tool that allows users to explore and
            understand the world&apos;s languages without barriers. We want to empower people to
            learn about languages, their relationships, and their relevance in today&apos;s digital
            world.

            The Language Navigator is designed to provide actionable insights into the world of
            languages. We aim to help people make informed decisions about language use--whether in
            spoken context or digital communication. We also acknowledge that many of the languages
            represented here are endangered, or while thriving in spoken form, remain unsupported on
            digital platforms. Depending on your goals, this insight might inspire support
            efforts—or influence strategic prioritization.

            recognized by specific communities, even if they lack global consensus. Where data is
            disputed or incomplete, we aim for transparency. Users can see{' '}

            The various language IDs (eg. ISO 3166 territory codes or language glottcodes) come from
            their respective original database (ISO, Glottolog, CLDR). When an object has multiple
            identities, it has been manually matched by the Language Navigator team to a single
            entity. For instance, English is represented in CLDR by the ISO 639-1 code{' '}
            <a href={getNewURL({ languageSchema: LanguageSchema.CLDR, objectID: 'eng' })}>en</a>,
            the ISO 639-3 code{' '}
            <a href={getNewURL({ languageSchema: LanguageSchema.ISO, objectID: 'eng' })}>eng</a>,
            and the Glottocode{' '}
            <a href={getNewURL({ languageSchema: LanguageSchema.Glottolog, objectID: 'eng' })}>
              stan1293

            .
          </dd>
          <dt>Names</dt>
          <dd>
            The names are sourced from the original databases, with some manual adjustments to
            ensure consistency and clarity. When swapping between different language definitions the
            language names will update to match the one provided by the source for that definition.
            For example, Chinese as a macrolanguage is called &quot;Classical-Middle-Modern
            Sinitic&quot; in Glottolog.
          </dd>
          <dt>Population</dt>
          <dd>
            The population data comes from many sources. Some estimates are directly imported from
            government censuses or academic papers -- sometimes we had to interpret the intended
            language (eg. is &quot;Malay&quot; referring to standard Malay, vernacular Malay, or
            Malay as a macrolanguage). Some come from secondary sources like Ethnologue or CLDR. A
            few estimates, especially for regional locales, are approximations based on the related
            data.
