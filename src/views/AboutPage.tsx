        The <strong>Lang</strong>uage <strong>Navi</strong>gator is a tool designed to help people
        explore and understand the relationships between different languages. It provides a
        user-friendly interface for visualizing language families, dialects, and other linguistic
        features and how they are situated across the globe.

            The Language Navigator is a free and open-source project. We believe that language data
            should be accessible to everyone, and we are committed to making this tool available to
            all.

            The Language Navigator is designed to provide actionable insights into the world of
            languages. We aim to help people make informed decisions about language use in both
            spoken context as well as written or internet contexts. Unfortunately, this acknowledges
            that many languages shown here are dying or even if they are thriving in person, they
            are not used in computing devices. Depending on the aim of the reader that could
            motivate them to improve support or to wait and focus efforts on other languages that
            are more likely to be used.

            The Language Navigator aims to show the diversity of languages and dialects around the

            ones that are not univesally recognized. When information is contested -- we will try to
